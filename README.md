Large Data: Predicting Taxi Travel Time

Download the TaxiData from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wi1HZItFGBwaCq8cTwjxk_GvUP0p9mR-/view?usp=sharing
Extract it at the project folder, so that, for example, a csv file's path is: '.../PredictingTaxiTravelTime/TaxiData/assignment1_data-1.csv'
File ".gitinore" is set, so we can just keep TaxiData in your local folder, and these data won't be committed or pushed.
